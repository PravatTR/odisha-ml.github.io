# Micro fluidics based Lab-on-a-chip systems development for developing economies

Mentor: Arohi Kumar Barai  

## Problem

Microfluidics based Lab-on-a-chip systems are efficient, high-speed, string throughput, and accurate. Still, they
are expensive to produce due to a lack of local manufacturing/ production facilities or uniform global market
adoption. Despite advancement in medical device research, affordable customizable diagnostic devices/medical
test kits are still a distant dream for many developing nation.

## Solution

Design, development, prototyping, and fabrication of intelligent Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) system with in-house
inexpensive micro fluidic automation system.

## Product

Modular development of the custom-built lab-on-a-chip system. Few Products of interests:

3.1.1. LOC Devices for Point-of-care testing i.e. Covid-19/Malaria antigen Test kit, Digital dipstick.
3.1.2. Paper-based micro-fluidic devices for various Enzyme linked Immunoassays test kits.
3.1.3. Dielectrophoresis based LOC for cell separation, sorting, rotation, and manipulation of organic & inorganic
particles (ex. Microplastic detection, sampling, and filtration).
3.1.4. Organ-on-chip (OOC) for simulation, analysis of the activities, mechanics, and physiological response of
various human organs such as lungs, kidneys, liver, guts, heart, etc.
3.1.5.The implementation of AI & ML in creating robust and intelligent LOC systems for industrial application.
3.1.6. Design, development, and commercial production of an AI enabled smart, low cost micro-fluidic
automation kit (pump, valve, controller etc.)
